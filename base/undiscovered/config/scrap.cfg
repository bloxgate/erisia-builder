    # Each table below will have a bag generated for it. Only put one entry per line in the format of 'name@domain:path@xpdice@#GearColor@#PlateColor' with no commas. You can omit one or both of the Color Options to use defaults. Using a Single color will result in both the gear and plate being the same tint. XP is award in Dice notation. For example 2d6 would roll 2 6-sided dice and return the results. Anywhere from 2 to 12
